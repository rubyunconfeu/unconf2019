# ruby-unconf 2019 orga
The Repository is used to plan the ruby unconf 2019.

## Process
We have a core team which is split up in the small teams from 2-3 people.
Each of those small teams is responsible for a mean task of the unconf organisation.
Our communication is mainly remotely.
We have regularly meetings which are used to give a status update.
Our planning is done mainly via Github issues.
